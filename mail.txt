Subject: Request to Reschedule Internal Viva for Major Project

Respected Sir,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to respectfully request a rescheduling of my upcoming internal viva for my major project. Currently scheduled for May 16, 2024, I kindly ask for the viva to be moved to May 18, 2024.

The reason behind my request is that I am currently employed at Grazitti Interactive,Panchkula through the college placement program. Unfortunately, due to the demanding nature of my responsibilities, I find it challenging to secure leave on weekdays. However, I can ensure my presence for the viva on May 18, 2024, as it falls on a Saturday, allowing me to manage my professional commitments effectively while also fulfilling my academic obligations.

I understand the importance of adhering to the academic calendar and the significance of maintaining the integrity of assessments. Rest assured, this request is made with utmost consideration for the academic standards of our institution.

Your prompt gesture will be highly appreciated

Sincerely yours,

Rakshu Chauhan
